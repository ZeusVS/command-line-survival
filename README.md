### Command Line Survival
Simple survival game made in python as part of the boot.dev course

#### Install instructions:
Due to the used modules and terminal escape codes this will only work on linux
(and maybe on mac)

You will need to install the following python modules:
- pywinctl
- pynput

To start the game just execute "python main.py"

#### Game instructions:
- 'wasd' or 'hjkl' to move
- 'q' to quit
- 'r' to restart after losing

Please note this is a work in progress.
